### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a pharmacometrics consultant, a founder and partner at [Occams](https://www.occams.com), and a fellow and past president of the [International Society of Pharmacometrics (ISoP)](https://www.isop.org).

Also an #rstats fan. I maintain [pmxTools](https://www.github.com/kestrel99/pmxTools) and I'm part of the [nlmixr2](https://www.github.com/nlmixr2/nlmixr2) dev team.

I'm on <link rel="me" href="https://fosstodon.org/@justinwilkins">Mastodon</a>!
